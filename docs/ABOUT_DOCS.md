# PUZZ ENGINE DOCUMENTATION

This is the documentation for the PUZZ engine. It is a part of the [PUZZ ENGINE](https://github.com/jossse69/PUZZ) project.
This documentation is still in progress, as the API is still not complete and may change in the future.
A good place to start is the [README.md](https://github.com/jossse69/PUZZ/blob/master/README.md) file, it has a simple example.

## Getting Started
The [Tutorials](https://github.com/jossse69/PUZZ/tree/master/docs/tutorials) contains basic examples of how to use the engine, as well details on how to create your own game and how this engine works.
a good place to check for more information is the [Wiki of the engine](https://github.com/jossse69/PUZZ/wiki) for details on the API.
have fun creating your own game! :D
